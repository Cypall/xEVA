			mes "The player who deals the most damage to the monster, takes the most Experience Points .It is based on the percentage of damage you do. You can get more Experience Points by doing more damages.";

			mes "When you trade with merchants, Please always check the price of item. Here is a tip, Zeny is separated with a comma after every three units. like this: '2,000' '20,000' '200,000'.";
